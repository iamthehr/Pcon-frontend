export const roundsSuggestion = `There were 5 rounds.
4 technical and 1 HR.
The first 2 rounds were based on Data structures and Algorithms.
The next 2 rounds tested System Design knowledge.
The 5th one was the behavioral round.`;

export const questionsSuggestion = `Algorithm rounds:
There were questions from arrays, linked lists, and hash maps.
The questions were of medium difficulty.
The next round was quite difficult, as they asked me to design a fictional data structure that has a constant time complexity for all CRUD operations.
Then they asked 2 dynamic programming questions and then there was a graph-based question. (A modification of Dijkstra)

System Design rounds:
They asked me to design a video streaming platform (Netflix clone).
They tested my knowledge of databases, messaging queues, horizontal, and vertical scaling.

Behavioral round:
The interviewer tested me on how would I react to various situations.
They look for candidates with strong leadership skills and a high team spirit.`;

export const adviceSuggestion = `Focus on building strong problem-solving skills, also work on at least one really good project. Be calm and confident.`;
